- I think people vary a good amount for all these things, I believe these more strongly for myself than for others.
- I didn't have a great measure for addictingness, another option I thought about was (# of times I would do the thing vs. # I wanted ot do).
- A lot of the badness for me of addicting things is that they make me feel not in control. I hate feeling like I can't choose to eat less if I don't want to for instance.
- I put facebook/twitter at slightly more addicting and slightly worse than news/sports scores.
- I've never done cocaine, but my average estimate for it was -2 on the life satisfaction score, while my average for dessert was about -0.5. So for me, dessert addiction feels roughly 1 - 5 deca-cocaines worth of badness (i.e. 1/10th - 1/2 as bad).
- My dad used to work for a candy company, and they'd optimize their recipe by bringing in people, giving them free giant bowls of candy, and seeing which recipes led to people eating the most. I think people underestimate how aggressively companies have optimized on making things as addicting as possible (food, facebook, etc.). I like my new framing of "deca-cocaines" for me to quantify just how addicting these things are.

- # times thinking about also strongly correlates with # of times I do the thing.
- For me, if I have a policy of only doing something rarely (never - once/month), I basically never think about doing it. But as soon as I get up to once/week, and especially at once/day, the number of times I think about it starts increasingly rapidly. 
- I've experimented the most with this with dessert. At once/day - 3 times/day, it'll be fine for days - weeks (although it'll be on my mind much more than that), but then one day I'll be stressed or tired and binge and feel bad about myself. I did a couple years at dessert roughly once/year, and have been doing roughly once/month for the last year, and found that I don't binge at all like that. People ask me "how do you have so much will power to eat it so rarely!?" I say: what!? If I had will power I'd eat it 3 times a day -- it's specifically because of my lack of will power that the policy "roughly once a month" works wonders for me.
- I have intuitions that this might be backed up by further research (e.g. brain feedback loops expect things if you do them frequently), but this is a napkin sketch for a reason :), and again I expect there to be large individual variation. I know of a handful of other people that have experiemnted with similar things and found the "rarely" option liberating.
- I think the body positivity movement does at least one very good thing and one questionable thing. The very good thing is that for people who feel bad about food, it helps them feel less bad about it. The questionable thing is that I feel pretty confident that for me, the "leave dessert in your house and don't feel bad eating it every day!" thing would be counterproductive because it would lead to me thnking about dessert and binging on it much more frequently. And again, I expect this to differ by person, and am not judging you for feeling differently.
