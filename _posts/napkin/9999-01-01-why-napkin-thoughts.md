- I want to discuss high-value ideas, but don't want to spend time to polish them.
- By getting faster feedback on core ideas, I can improve them faster and then choose which to make better.
- It seems useful to spend more time building models vs. passively consuming content. A lot of thoughtful people have emphasized making toy models to play around with ideas and think through things on their own.
