Most people who care about helping others follow a strategy that seems reasonable: find a field that you care about (e.g. criminal justice reform, education, public health, voting), try to find promising interventions in that field, and pursue those. I did this for many years. If interventions had similar orders of magnitude of impact, this would be a reasonable strategy. Unfortunately, interventions look more like a power law, and power laws are counterintuitive.

[The world’s biggest problems](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/world-problems/) by 80,000 hours lays all of this out pretty well, but I'm going to take some of their links and then focus on taking the conclusion of top interventions mattering a lot more than pretty good interventions seriously.

"Cost-effectiveness of health interventions as found in the Disease Controls Priorities Project 2. See [“The moral imperative towards cost-effectiveness in global health”](https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/1427016_file_moral_imperative_cost_effectiveness.pdf) by Toby Ord for more explanation."

The median intervention on this graph is 5 DALYs/$1000 -- "DALY is a "disability adjusted life year” i.e. a year of life lost to ill health – the opposite of a “quality adjusted life year"". Eye-balling the 75th percentile, it's at about 50 DALYs/$1000. The top intervnetion is at 300 DALYs/$1000, 6x the 75th percentile and 60x the median.

People near the 75th percentile look at everyone else in their field and say "Look! We're making real change, and we're better than almost everyone." But they're still 6x worse than the top intervention, and we should spend 6x more on the top intervention.

If you have 10 friends, and they're all smart and thoughtful about how to have impact, they're probably somewhere between the median and the top. Let's just assume they're randomly distributed between the 50th percentile and the 100th percentile. Even though all 10 of those friends are working on useful things, and even though all 10 of them think they've thought through how to have the most impact, the top one of those friends is making something like 10-50x as much impact as the least impactful.

Now, there are important follow-up questions. Does intervention X (e.g. criminal justice, education) look like this? How do interventions in criminal justice compare to health? I'm not going into the details here, but the answer is yes, other fields look like this, and there's also a hierarchy between fields -- the most effective fields have multiples of impact compared to less effective ones.

It's fairly straightforward to dig into the data and figure out if the above is true -- I think many effective altruists, including myself, strongly disagreed with this until we dug into the data ourselves. But if you do that, and you figure out this holds, it makes no sense to going back to doing "pretty good" things.
