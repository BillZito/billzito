- I think people vary a good amount for all these things, I believe these more strongly for myself than for others.
- I didn't have a great measure for addictingness, another option I thought about was (# of times I would do the thing vs. # I wanted ot do).
- A lot of the badness for me of addicting things is that they make me feel not in control. I hate feeling like I can't choose to eat less if I don't want to for instance.
