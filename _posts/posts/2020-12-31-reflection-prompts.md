Some reflection prompts I've used in the past.

## Weekly
* 30m - 1h, bullet point list of 2-3 things that went well and 3 - 10 things I want to improve for the next week, priority ranked (P0, P1, P2)
* Imagine I am the CEO of whatever it is I’m working on -- what are the biggest problems?
* Look over any weekly goals or daily tracking and think about what to improve (work, sleep, nutrition, exercise).
* Imagine myself 30 years from now, and I’ve done all the big things I want to do in life. What advice would that person give me?
* Murphyjitsu for the most important things I want to improve for next week.

## Every 1 - 3 months
* Do some thinking about if I’m headed in the right direction in life generally.
* Am I very excited about what I’m doing and the 5 people I’m spending most of my time with? If it’s not a “hell yes,” it’s a no (see “Biggest learnings” for what I mean).
* The 30 years from now prompt. 
* Read one to a few blogs from role models (either their advice to others or stories about them) -- think about what advice they would give you.
* How can I make this next month the most productive of my life?
* Write out my ideal schedule for the next week (which people that I’m spending time with, how much I’m working on x and y). Then write out what I’m actually doing. How can I cut out the things I don’t want to be doing and add the things I do want to be doing?
* What are my most important cruxes for my current life choices vs. other things I could be doing?
* How can I do 10x as much as I’ve done previously? 
* How can I accomplish what I want to in 10 years in 1 year?
* Who are the people in the world that seem to have the most important things figured out? How can I spend more time with them?
* Hamming circle prompts are pretty good. 

## Some learnings from doing weekly / daily reflections
* Re: “am I very excited” -- my general heuristic is that if it’s not a “hell yes” it’s a no (it’s easy for me to get complacent with my current situation and forget what it was like when I was really excited about what I was doing). I believe I have a pretty significant bias towards staying where I am, because I have basically always regretted staying in situations longer than I should have vs. have never regretted leaving something too early yet.
* There’s never a good time to give someone bad news (e.g. it’s tempting to put off quitting a job or breaking up with someone, but it’s easy to put that off for months when it’s probably not good to).
* It’s very common for me to think my ideas for what to do in life from 1 - 3 years ago are really dumb in hindsight, so I should have humility that my current plan has some key flaws.
* Focus is super important, and I feel much more productive when I decide to do one thing all out vs. trying to do two things at once (e.g. a job and learning something else).
