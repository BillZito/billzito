- You’re g, d is your cousin on your dads side and grandpa on moms side. A is dad, sibs with b. B and c have d together, making d your cousin. D has f with e, who in turn has a child with a, making you. D is your cousin and your grandparent.
- In West Virginia it's legal to marry your second-cousin, who shares ~1/32 of your genes. Assuming it's the gene percent that matters, I think it’d be legal in West Virginia if we added two more generations between D and F, making A and F the equivalent of second cousins. D would be your great great grandparent and cousin.
