- You’re G, D is your cousin on your dad's side and grandpa on mom's side. A is dad, sibs with B. B and C have D together, making D your cousin. D has F with E, who in turn has a child with A, making you.
- In West Virginia, it's legal to marry your second-cousin, who shares ~1/32nd of your genes. Assuming it's the gene percent that matters, I think it’d be legal in West Virginia for A and F to marry if we added two more generations between D and F (I'm not showing my work, sry). D would be your great great grandparent and cousin.
