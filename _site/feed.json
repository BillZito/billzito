I, like everyone, do this to myself surprisingly frequently without noticing it. Common examples of just-a-bitting that people express some misgivings about are watching Netflix, reading Hackernews / your favorite way to browse the internet, playing video games, and eating cookies. But you can also just-a-bit yourself with lots of other things. Once I get in a good writing flow, I don’t want to stop. It’s the same for programming and for soccer.As those last examples suggest, it can actually be a very positive thing to just-a-bit myself. One of the best ways to get into a new hobby or career interest is to fall in love with the thing you’re learning to do. You can think of the task as: how do I design an activity, such that when I start, I am intrinsically motivated to keep going. Repeatedly just-a-bitting yourself is a core component of this.There’s also an important corollary to the positive reinforcement of repeated actions. If you can cut a thing out of your life completely, your brain will often stop desiring the thing soon after stopping (like, within a few days for many things in my experience).Up until age 13, I used to play something like an hour of video games a day. But then one day I decided it wasn’t worth that much time, and cut it out completely. What surprised me is that after a few days of not playing, I also didn’t desire to play. There appears to be an important shift between “thinking about whether I want something every day” vs. “I never do this” – if I don’t need to consider the decision, I don’t think about it at all.There are many biological needs that one cannot cut out. Humans need enough of many types of nutrients, and people feel hungry if they don’t eat enough of those. Friendship, exercise, and sex are also core needs. But for many of the things we do habitually, the desire to do them diminishes greatly by not doing it all.Two of the most common things to just-a-bit oneself about are disputes and money, and as PG says, it’s easy to let these things become the “top idea” in one’s mind – the thing we keep thinking about constantly throughout the day.In addition to trying not to get into fights in the first place, another tricky part about disputes is that there’s often a component from one party of “I don’t want to talk about this right now.” If the dispute matters a lot to at least one person, it can then be very hard to stop thinking about the dispute until it is resolved.I don’t know of a one-size-fits-all solution for this unfortunately. One thing that seems to help me is to have a set time when I will talk about the thing next, so that I can comfort myself in knowing “we will resolve this tomorrow” instead of feeling a need to figure out how to solve the thing. Another thing I tried recently was trying to notice every time I was thinking about the dispute, and to just write down on paper how I was feeling as soon as I noticed, without judgement for getting caught up in it. This was helpful for preventing just-a-bitting, as I had a simple action for what I should do when it comes up.Interestingly, I also noticed that I wasn’t actually angry almost all of the times I started thinking about the dispute – I only got angry when I let myself keep thinking about all of the details of the disagreement. This helped me feel like the dispute actually wasn’t a big deal, and that I didn’t have to keep thinking about it as often.Every once in a while, I try to just write down all the things that I’m doing regularly. Oftentimes I find that I’m just-a-bitting myself on something that I don’t actually want to be doing. And sometimes, just by not doing the thing for a few days or changing my mindset about starting the thing in the first place, I can greatly reduce the desire to do the thing.",

            "content_text": "The Enchiridion by Epictetus, 135AC lays out some useful frames on how to live, especially for managing one’s emotions. Epictetus was a philosopher of stoicism (I knew nothing about stoicism before reading The Enchiridion). If you read numbers 1 - 10 (of 50), that’s maybe 60% of the value for 20m of effort. H/t to A for the recommendation. As always, other’s hot-takes appreciated.My takeaways:  One main idea is to only care about things in your control (your actions and feelings about events) instead of things out of your control (other’s actions, reputation, circumstances of your e.g. body and family). While this seems obvious as stated, the details of actually taking this serious are useful. Reputation is one interesting example. It feels like something we can control (by being awesome), but by focusing only on the actions (the being awesome) and not other’s beliefs, it can free us from unproductive worrying. Similarly, envy towards others is less productive than thinking about actions one wants to take. There’s an underlying theme in much of the work of trying to not care at all about other’s beliefs, which although hard to do in practice, seems useful to consider doing more of.  I also liked thinking about what it’d be like to not care about other’s decisions. I have some strong beliefs about how people should pursue their lives, and I sometimes let myself worry about if my friends and loved ones are making all the decisions that I want them to. While it seems good to try to convince friends of things sometimes, I think it’s healthy to stay focused on “shooting one’s best shot” in trying to convince them, and then not worrying as much about the result. As with most “sales,” the first rule of sales is that deals fall through, and you have to learn to not get upset about that.  I liked the analogy of living life as if you were at a dinner party, esepcially the bit about not stretching for things that have not come yet. I have lots of goals in life, and so it’s easy for me to spend a bunch of cycles worrying about accomplishing those goals. I think it’s healthier to internalize realisitic time frames of when things will get done by, and to not spend too much time yearning for things that realistically can’t be accomplished very quickly.  Another useful thing that I’m going to try: thinking about what you want out of an environment to focus on keeping those things even if you get disrupted. E.g. when I go to sit at my desk to work, I want to be in a state of flow/ focused work, and sometimes when I’m tired or get interrupted, I end up being distracted for a long time. Focusing on the goal of the environment seems plausibly useful to do more of the good.More rapid fire:  Stay focused on the ship even during side quests, else you’ll get swept up in them. Useful to keep as many cycles on the most important things as possible.  “I have returned it” is a powerful frame on loss – the mistake people make is that they take the people and things they have in their life for granted, whereas “I have returned it” makes the fleeting nature more clear. This made me think about my grandma’s memoir, which says a lot of similar things that were really useful for me in thinking about “loss.” In particular, I like framing the overwhelming emotion of loss as “thank you for those great experiences” than “sad that I don’t get them anymore.”  Be wary of “If I neglect my affairs, I will have no income” —&gt; better to give it up and not be concerned. It’s easy to let us make excuses about the things we “have to do,” but it can be liberating to not force ourselves to do those things, and to take bigger risks for bigger rewards.  “You have your role, act it.” I believe in my own potential to do things, but I also have to be honest with myself about what I’m good at so that I can best accomplish my goals.  “Don’t hand mind to others.” Esepcially when I’m angry, I “hand my mind to others” in that I let myself get carried away in thinking about them. I like that frame for trying not to spend as much time worrying about disputes.Overall: I definitely recommend reading, and it’s a quick read (although sometimes hard to parse). I think there is a lot of good “mental jijitsu” in how to reframe problems to not let them take up unproductive cycles.",

Tara (the author) manages to tell the story as she experienced it without passing judgement on her family for things they did wrong, giving us a clearer view of the struggle to figure out what is “true” when living for decades in others’ distorted (and sometimes abusive) realities. I’m interested in other’s hot-takes, and if you haven’t read it yet, take this as a pitch!My takeaways:  Especially when so many things that matter (family, livelihood, safety) are tied to our beliefs about the world, it can be very, very hard to figure out what is true. There is part of her (and part of me) that wants to believe fake realities we’ve been told, and it took many years for both of us to step further away from those.  Guilt is a very powerful weapon for abusers – abusers decrease others’ self-worth and use that to get what they want. Abusers are kind sometimes, and rationalize their abuse to make it reality, leaving the abused with an alternative reality. Abusers often have some sociopathic qualities. And then they use the fact that the abused are not sociopathic to mainpulate them into thinking they are in the wrong.  One of the hardest things in figuring out how to deal with abusive people is that they seem to believe what they are saying, and can convincingly explain their side of the story without the years of first-hand experience to understand their patterns. It seems likely that many abusive people actually do believe their distorted stories – that lying to oneself and then being “honest” to others is common, maybe because humans have norms that it’s not ok to purposefully deceive people but that it is ok to be “mistaken” about what actually happened.  When you have to be self-reliant to survive, have tried to trust your loved ones and they’ve repeatedly failed you, it’s hard to ask for help. “I can fix this” is dangerous – sometimes we need to ask for help. Also, sometimes it’s better to decide not to abandon the problem altogether. This helped me realize ways in which I was being unnecessarily self-reliant.  So much of beliefs are based on what we’ve seen happen in similiar situations – it takes conscious effort to think about what one should say instead of the brain’s auto-fill function. It’s wild how many people never escape from the “reality” they are born into, and further wild that even those who do learn to believe other things still have trouble breaking free of cached beliefs and habits.  The book helped me develop more empathy for Trump supporters and other people that seem to live in different realities than I do. When everyone around you believes a version of events that is very believable without a bunch of effort to learn other things, and when there are strong incentives to believe what others believe to fit in, have a family, job, etc., it’s very hard to break free.",

            "content_text": "  I think people vary a good amount for all these things.  I didn’t have a great measure for addictingness. Another option I thought about was (# of times I would do the thing vs. # I wanted to do).  A lot of the badness for me of addicting things is that they make me feel like I’m not in control of my actions. I hate feeling like I can’t choose to eat less if I don’t want to.  I think facebook/twitter are slightly more addicting and slightly worse than news/sports scores.  I’ve never done cocaine, but my average estimate for it was -2 on the life satisfaction score, while my average for dessert was about -0.5. So for me, dessert addiction feels roughly 0.1x - 0.5x as bad. I like my new framing of “deca-cocaines” for me to quantify just how addicting these things are (e.g. 0.1x-0.5x is 1-5 deca-cocaines).  My dad used to work for a candy company, and they’d optimize their recipe by bringing in people, giving them free giant bowls of candy, and seeing which recipes led to people eating the most. I think people underestimate how aggressively companies have optimized on making things as addicting as possible (food, facebook, etc.).Substitutes for news/sports scores:  Eat, drink.  Walk, juggle a soccer ball.  Text a friend.  Journal, doodle.  Read better blog posts.  Watch educational youtube.  Play with an educational app like universe in a nutshell.  [Not good] book/podcast (too long a commitment / effortful).  For me, if I have a policy of only doing something rarely (never - once/month), I basically never think about doing it. But as soon as I get up to once/week, and especially at once/day or above, the number of times I think about it starts increasingly rapidly.  I’ve experimented the most with this with dessert. At once/day - 3 times/day, it won’t feel bad for days - months, but then one day I’ll be stressed or tired and binge and feel bad about myself. I did a couple years where I only ate dessert roughly once/year, and have been doing roughly once/month for the last year, and found that I don’t binge at all like that. People ask me “how do you have so much willpower to eat dessert so rarely!?” I say: what!? If I had willpower I’d eat it 3 times a day — it’s specifically because of my lack of willpower that the policy “roughly once a month” works wonders for me.  I know of a handful of other people that have experiemnted with similar things and found the “rarely” option liberating, but again I expect there to be large individual variation.  I think the body positivity movement does at least one very good thing and one questionable thing. The very good thing is that for people who feel bad about food, it helps them feel less bad about it. The questionable thing is that I feel pretty confident that for me, the “leave dessert in your house and don’t feel bad eating it every day!” thing would be counterproductive because it would lead to me thinking about dessert and binging on it much more frequently. And again, I expect this to differ by person, and am not judging you if you feel differently. As a wise person once said “some people want to eat more, some people want to eat less, and lots of people want to think about eating less.”",
