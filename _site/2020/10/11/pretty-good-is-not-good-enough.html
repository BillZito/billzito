I did this for many years. If interventions had similar orders of magnitude of impact, this would be a reasonable strategy. Unfortunately, I’m confident they do not.</p><p><a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/world-problems/">The world’s biggest problems</a> by 80,000 hours lays out an introduction to this argument pretty well, but I’m going to take one of the charts they cite and then focus on taking the conclusion of top interventions mattering a lot more than pretty good interventions seriously.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/BillZito/billzito.github.io/blob/master/assets/cost-effectiveness.png?raw=true" alt="cost-effectiveness" /></p><p>“Cost-effectiveness of health interventions as found in the Disease Controls Priorities Project 2. See <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/1427016_file_moral_imperative_cost_effectiveness.pdf">“The moral imperative towards cost-effectiveness in global health”</a> by Toby Ord for more explanation.”</p><p>I haven’t fact-checked the book that Toby Ord cites (which 80k then cites, which I then cite, which isn’t a good algorithm for a rigorous graph), but he seems like a pretty good researcher from his other work, and this is just a useful graph to get across something I have other evidence for.</p><p>The median intervention on this graph is 5 DALYs/$1000 – “DALY is a “disability adjusted life year” i.e. a year of life lost to ill health – the opposite of a “quality adjusted life year””. Eye-balling the 75th percentile, it’s at about 50 DALYs/$1000. The top intervention is at 300 DALYs/$1000, 6x the 75th percentile and 60x the median. Note that this top intervention seems a little too good to be true to me (AMF, one of GiveWell’s top charities, thinks it’s closer to 30 DALYs/$1000, so I think the 75th percentile is closer to the real max, at least for things that have the ability to accept large donations). As Toby notes if you click the link, DALY is a rough metric which has some error, but when interventions have &gt;100x difference in impact, that error is small compared to the difference in impact.</p><p>People above the 50th percentile look at everyone else in their field and say “Look! We’re making real change, and we’re better than so many people, not to mention the people that don’t even get added to a graph like this!” But they’re still 10x worse than the 75th percentile.</p><p>If you have 10 friends working in global health, and they’re all smart and thoughtful about how to have impact, they’re probably somewhere between the 25th percentile and the top. Let’s just assume they’re randomly distributed between the 25th percentile and the 100th percentile. Even though all 10 of those friends are working on useful things, and even though all 10 of them think they’ve thought through how to have the most impact, the top one of those friends is likely making &gt;10x as much impact as the least impactful.</p><p>That’s super counterintuitive to me at least. People naturally sort others they meet into “good” and “not so good,” but this means we need a higher bar.</p><p>There are important follow-up questions:</p><ol><li><p>Does intervention X (e.g. criminal justice, education) look like this? How do interventions in criminal justice compare to health? I don’t know enough to make super strong claims about what the distributions look like, but I do feel confident that most interventions have about 0 impact, and that there are at least a couple orders of magnitude difference between high-impact and low-impact interventions in a given field.</p></li><li><p>How much error is there when we estimate the impact of a new intervention we don’t know about? A lot, and it’s important to experiment with new things that could be in the top category. I think the EA community does a good job of funding experimental projects. But it’s also important not to waste our time with things that look a lot like things with little to no impact, which unfortunately I think is &gt;50% (and probably &gt;90%) of U.S. nonprofit funding.</p></li><li><p>Am I advocating we only work on a few top interventions? No. It’s important to spread out our resources somewhat, and oftentimes people will have developed specialized skills or other personal fit that make them better at working on specific things. But I think it’s still pretty clear that we can divert a lot of the 50-90+% of funding that we’re wasting onto things that we think might actually help pepole. On the margin, I want to move people towards more impactful work– I’m not arguing for some globally optimum algorithm for telling everyone exactly the 3 projects they should work on.</p></li><li><p>If you’ve gotten this far, <a href="https://80000hours.org/2020/08/misconceptions-effective-altruism/#top">common misconceptions about effective altruism</a> may also be of interest.</p></li></ol><p>I think a lot of highly capable people think they’re spending enough time figuring out the highest impact interventions when they’re not. The difference between being “one of the better interventions” and “being in the top few percent of interventions” seems likely to be &gt;10x.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2020-10-11T00:00:00-07:00">October 11, 2020</time> &middot; </span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2020-10-11T00:00:00-07:00">October 11, 2020</time> &middot; </span> --></section></main></body></html>
