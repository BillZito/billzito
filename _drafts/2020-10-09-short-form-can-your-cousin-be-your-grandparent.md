- Youâ€™re G, D is your cousin on your dad's side and grandpa on mom's side. A is dad, sibs with B. B and C have D together, making D your cousin. D has F with E, who in turn has a child with A, making you.
- In every state, it's legal to marry your second-cousin, who shares ~1/32nd of your genes (and in >10 states, it's [legal to marry your first cousin](https://www.thespruce.com/cousin-marriage-laws-listed-by-state-2300731)). Assuming it's the gene percent that matters, I think it should be legal in every state for A and F to marry if we added two more generations between D and F (I'm not showing my work, sry). It becomes harder for the age gap to work out, but is still possible. D would be your great great grandparent and cousin.
