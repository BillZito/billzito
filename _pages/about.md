Co-Founder and COO at Redwood Research. We do exploratory AI alignment research to try to reduce the chance of [existential risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk). I wear several hats there, including running our coworking space Constellation, supporting management and project management of technical teams, and helping align people on our organizational priorities.

Before Redwood, I was a software engineer at Aurora, a self-driving car startup, as it grew from 30 to 300. I helped build out engineering and operations teams for their ML labeling pipelines.
