Bill Zito is a human.

### Features

- I taught my family's dog how to sing to the piano over the course of a few days. He mostly sings a 5f#.
- I've juggled a soccer ball in over 30 states.
- I like [books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/107138592-bill-zito?order=d&ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=rating).
- I like people. If we've met, I probably remember you and like you.
- I like getting things done. I work a lot --- sometimes too much.
