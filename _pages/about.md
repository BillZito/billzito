Co-Founder and COO at Redwood Research. We do exploratory AI alignment research to try to reduce the chance of [existential risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk). I wear several hats there, including running the coworking space Constellation, supporting management and project management of technical teams, and helping align people on our organizational priorities.

Before Redwood, I was a software engineer at Aurora, a self-driving car startup, as it grew from 30 to 300. I helped build out engineering and operations teams for their ML labeling pipelines.

Outside of work, I play soccer, occasionally write [poems](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1g5lRuVwO-L4RgQp0yHDHV6qtOnWH6sLN), enjoy mischief in many forms, and like reading a lot. Some content I like: [ books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/107138592-bill-zito?shelf=five-stars&view=table), [movies/shows/podcasts](https://twitter.com/billzito1/status/1519903268863832067), and 	[poems](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1OmXlI-vnVMzEVq2plDkbz6YRgGyy8lnq).
