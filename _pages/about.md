I help run [Constellation](https://www.constellation.org), an AI safety research center. We host 100 people a day working on evals, alignment, and governance. I also helped start and was COO at [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org), which does AI alignment research grounded in futurism. Before that, I was an early software engineer at a now-public self-driving car startup.

Outside of work, I play soccer, create small amounts of chaos, read history, and occasionally write [poetry](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1g5lRuVwO-L4RgQp0yHDHV6qtOnWH6sLN). Some content I like: [ books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/107138592-bill-zito?shelf=favorites&view=table), [movies/shows/podcasts](https://twitter.com/billzito1/status/1519903268863832067), and 	[poetry](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1OmXlI-vnVMzEVq2plDkbz6YRgGyy8lnq).
