I help run Constellation, an AI safety research institute. We convene about 100 people a week working on alignment research, evals, and governance. I also helped start and was COO at Redwood Research, which does exploratory AI alignment research. Before that, I was a software engineer working on self-driving cars.

Outside of work, I play soccer, create small amounts of chaos, read, and occasionally write [poems](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1g5lRuVwO-L4RgQp0yHDHV6qtOnWH6sLN). Some content I like: [ books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/107138592-bill-zito?shelf=favorites&view=table), [movies/shows/podcasts](https://twitter.com/billzito1/status/1519903268863832067), and 	[poems](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1OmXlI-vnVMzEVq2plDkbz6YRgGyy8lnq).
