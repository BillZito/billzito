Bill Zito is a human.

### Features

- I once taught my family's dog how to sing to the piano. He mostly sings a 5F#. I on the other hand am more usually asked not to sing.
- I like people. If we've met, it's very likely that I like you.
- I like [books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/107138592-bill-zito?order=d&ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=rating).
- I like getting things done (especially when they're good things).
